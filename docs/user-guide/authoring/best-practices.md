Do not forget that workflows can be parametrized, allowing you to create generic experiments that can be launched with various different parameters.
It is up to you to find the good granularity when writing workflows;
some will prefer to write a few very generic workflows, taking many parameters allowing to simulate a lot of use cases;
others will prefer to write more workflows, but each one being more focused on a specific use case.

Versioning them.
