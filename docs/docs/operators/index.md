title: Operators

Although the Accio framework is agnostic to the underlying operators, the way they are implemented and data they manipulate, Accio has been historically built to study location privacy.
It is visible when we look at the data types supported by the [workflow DSL](../workflow-dsl.html), which contains several spatio-temporal-related types.
Moreover, Accio is for now only packaged with a operators aiming at studying location privacy.

The standard set of operators encompasses many state-of-the-art algorithms about location privacy, such as Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs), evaluation metrics, as well as generic spatio-temporal data manipulation tools.
Accio has been used and is being used by privacy researchers to help them launch experiments and analyse their results.
