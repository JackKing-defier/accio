We use [Javascript ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/), transpiled thanks to Babel and [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to build reactive user interfaces.
React code is compiled into a single Javascript file, that is then served through the server.
It uses directly the REST API to access Accio data.
